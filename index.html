            <h2>About Me...</h2>
            <p>Every person has their own unique story. Here is a glimpse into mine.
                I have been in the customer service industry for almost a decade. However, in 2021, just like everyone
                else
                in the US, I have decided to make a significant career change. I enrolled myself in Rutgers Coding
                Bootcamp
                to start my new career as a Web Developer, and I am incredibly excited.
                <br />
                I live in Rahway, New Jersey, with my daughter and a fluffy pet. My daughter is my greatest
                motivation and the reason I am doing this transition.
                <br />
                Outside of work and parenting, I enjoy running, hiking, biking, and any type of workout.
                <br />
                A fun fact about me, I was born in Colombia and raised on a multi-generational coffee plantation. I can
                say
                I come from where the best coffee in the world is grown. The fun fact is that, ironically, my family
                only
                drinks instant coffee, and I never got to taste the best coffee in the world until much later in life.

                <h3>Top Recipes</h3>
                <p> With the motivation of approaching a recipe library without the hustle of reading personal stories, 
                    my team and I develop Top Recipes. A website that offers you a diverse search of recipes, allowing you to save your favorite dishes. 
                    <br/> 
                    Most of the recipes provide a wine pairing suggestion where you can use the widget to help you search for wines to complement your meal.
